OpenEmu Lite is a stripped-down version of OpenEmu created by Wowfunhappy (that's me!) to simplify the user interface and maintain compatibility with legacy operating systems. Although I am extremely happy with the final, compiled product, the source is an absolute mess in dire need of cleanup.

You can download OpenEmu Lite from my website, jonathanalland.com/old-osx-projects. The original OpenEmu's readme is below.

OpenEmu is an open source project to bring game emulation to OS X as a first class citizen, leveraging modern OS X technologies such as Cocoa, Core Animation and Quartz, and 3rd party libraries like Sparkle for auto-updating. OpenEmu is based on a modular architecture, allowing for game-engine plugins, this means OpenEmu can support a host of different emulation engines and back-ends while retaining a familiar OS X native front-end. 

Currently OpenEmu can load the following game engines as plugins:

* CrabEmu  - adds support for Sega Master System, Game Gear, SG - 1000
* Gambatte  - adds support for Game Boy and Game Boy Color
* Genesis Plus - adds support for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive
* NeoPop - adds support for Neo Geo Pocket and Neo Geo Pocket Color
* Nestopia - adds support for NES/Famicom
* FCEU - adds support for NES/Famicom
* SNES9x - adds support for SNES and Super Famicom
* BSNES - adds support for SNES and Super Famicom
* Visualboy Advance - adds support for Game Boy Advance

OpenEmu also supports high quality scaling with Open GL, multi-threaded video and audio playback as well as individual features and preferences per game engine, such as NTSC video signal emulation for the Nestopia core.

Minimum system requirements:

* OS X 10.7
* Core 2 Duo Processor
* GMA X3100 Graphics
